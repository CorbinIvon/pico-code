# Raspberry Pi Pico Project Collection

Welcome to the Raspberry Pi Pico Project Collection! This repository is dedicated to sharing and collaborating on projects designed exclusively for the Raspberry Pi Pico series. Our aim is to build a vibrant community of hobbyists, educators, and professionals who are passionate about developing and sharing code that unleashes the full potential of the Raspberry Pi Pico's capabilities.

## About the Raspberry Pi Pico

The Raspberry Pi Pico is a tiny, fast, and versatile board built using the RP2040, a brand-new microcontroller chip developed by the Raspberry Pi team. With the Pico, you can create incredible projects thanks to its rich set of peripherals and accessible price point.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Raspberry Pi Pico, you'll need a few things:

- A Raspberry Pi Pico board
- Micro-USB cable for programming
- Installation of Python 3 and Thonny IDE or any preferred code editor that supports MicroPython or C/C++ for RP2040
